#Overview
This school project simulates machine learning by predicting the number and pattern of deaths caused by covid-19 overtime based on given data. The application utilizes Stochastic Gradient Descent to train a PyTorch model

##Functionality
Stochastic Gradient Descent: a simple yet very efficient approach to fitting linear classifiers and regressors under convex loss functions such as (linear) Support Vector Machines and Logistic Regression.
